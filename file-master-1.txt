angladesh's most important bilateral relations are with the two regional powers India and China. 
The relationship with India is bound by shared ideals of democracy, cultural heritage and the 1971 Liberation War, 
in which Indian military and diplomatic support was crucial in defeating Pakistani forces on Bangladeshi territory. 
In the early years of Bangladesh's independence, Dhaka and Delhi enjoyed a strong alliance. However, 
when military coups began in Bangladesh during the late 1970s, there was increasing distance between the two neighbors. 
Differences emerged over sharing the water of the Ganges. 

Bangladesh developed very warm relations with the People's Republic of China in the 1980s. 
Defense cooperation rapidly increased as the Bangladeshi military became one of the largest buyers of Chinese defense equipment, 
given their relative cost-effective attractiveness for the Bangladeshi defence budget.[180] China has supplied Bangladesh with missiles and frigates. 
China is also one of Bangladesh's largest trade partners. 

In more recent years, India has sought to revive relations with Bangladesh through a strategic partnership focused on counter-terrorism, 
aid for infrastructure development and promoting regional economic integration. Bangladesh and India are the largest trading partners among SAARC nations. 
The Indian and Bangladeshi armed forces maintain robust strategic engagement. Relations with Pakistan have been affected by issues related to the 1971 genocide and terrorism. 
Bangladesh enjoys strong ties with regional neighbors Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
